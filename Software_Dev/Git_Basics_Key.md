## ✅ **Git & GitHub — Answer Key**

**1.**
Source control (or version control) is a system that tracks changes to files and allows multiple people to work on the same codebase without overwriting each other’s work.

**2.**
A Git repository is a storage space where your project’s files and their entire version history are kept. It can be local (on your computer) or remote (on a platform like GitHub).

**3.**
`git add --all` stages **all changes** in the working directory — including new, modified, and deleted files — so they’re ready to be committed.

**4.**
`git commit -m "my comment"` saves the staged changes to the repository’s history with a descriptive message about what was changed.

**5.**
`git push` uploads your local commits to a remote repository (like GitHub), making them available to others.

**6.**
`git pull` updates your local repository with any new commits from the remote repository — it’s like doing a fetch and merge in one step.

**7.**
You create a branch to work on a feature, bug fix, or experiment without affecting the main (production) code. It helps isolate changes until they’re ready to merge.

**8.**
`git clone` creates a local copy of a remote repository, including its history, branches, and configuration.
